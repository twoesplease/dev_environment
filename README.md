### Dotfiles &amp; gems &amp; brew list, oh my! ###

A collection of configuration files, software, & settings that I can use to get a new machine running 
or share my settings with someone else as desired.

I grabbed the makesymlinks.sh file from here: http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/
